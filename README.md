## CPP MODULE 0 to 4 - 42

# Description:
A comprehensive C++ learning project through 5 modules that introduces Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals. The project covers essential C++ concepts from basic syntax and classes to advanced topics like polymorphism, inheritance, and abstract classes. Each module builds upon previous knowledge, starting with simple programs and evolving into complex class hierarchies and design patterns. 

# Context:
Part of 42 Common Core. C++ learning

# Main Technologies / Skills Used:

- **Programming Languages:**  C++98
- **Basic-Oriented Programming:** Classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction
- **Advanced-Oriented Programming:** Orthodox Canonical Form, abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphic behavior
- **Memory Management:** Dynamic allocation with new/delete, avoiding memory leaks, deep vs shallow copying
- **Advanced C++ Concepts:** Virtual functions, pure virtual functions, operator overloading, static members
- **String Manipulation:** C++ string class usage, stream operations, and file I/O
- **Mathematical Programming:** Fixed-point arithmetic implementation, operator overloading for mathematical operations
- **Error Handling:** Input validation, boundary checking, and robust program design
- **Makefile Management:** Compilation automation with proper flags (-Wall -Wextra -Werror)
- **Testing & Debugging:** Comprehensive test case development and constructor/destructor lifecycle management
